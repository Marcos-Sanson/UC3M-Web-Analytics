        "This lab was part of my **Web Analytics** course at **Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)**, where I studied abroad from **September 2024 to December 2024** as part of my Computer Science degree. This specific lab focused on **retrieving, processing, and analyzing economic and environmental indicators** using the **World Bank API**. The lab introduced API-based data retrieval methods to access **real-world country-level indicators**, such as **population, GDP, CO₂ emissions, and income distribution**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Working in a group of three students, we explored **REST API requests**, data extraction, and processing JSON responses to gain insights from the World Bank's global economic dataset.  \n",

        "### **API-Based Data Retrieval and Analysis**  \n",

        "- Fetching **country-level population data** and identifying **top and bottom 10 countries** by population.  \n",
        "- Computing **gender population distributions** and identifying **countries with more women or men**.  \n",
        "- Analyzing **GDP per capita** trends for different income groups over **2000-2022** and **2010-2022**.  \n",
        "- Identifying the **top 5 countries in GDP growth per income group** from **2010-2022**.  \n",

        "- **Bottom 10 least populous countries**, including **Tuvalu, Nauru, and Palau**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Milestone 2: Gender Population Disparities**  \n",
        "We computed the percentage of **men vs. women in each country** and analyzed global gender imbalances:\n",
        "- **139 countries had more women than men**, with **Hong Kong, Moldova, and Macao** leading in female-majority populations.  \n",
        "- **78 countries had more men than women**, with **Qatar, UAE, and Maldives** having the highest male-majority populations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Milestone 3: GDP Per Capita Growth Analysis**  \n",
        "We retrieved **GDP per capita** data from **2000, 2010, and 2022** for different **World Bank income groups** and computed percentage growth rates:  \n",
        "- **Low-income economies (LIC):** **+140.4%** (2000-2022)  \n",
        "- **Lower-middle-income economies (LMC):** **+334.5%** (2000-2022)  \n",

        "- **Low-income economies:** **Ethiopia (+205.8%)** and **Somalia (+161.5%)** had the highest growth.  \n",
        "- **Lower-middle-income economies:** **Bangladesh (+258.7%)** led among developing nations.  \n",

        "#### **Milestone 5: CO₂ Emissions Per Capita**  \n",
        "We retrieved the **most recent CO₂ emissions per capita** (metric tons) for all countries and ranked the **top 30 highest emitters**. The results showed that **countries with small populations and high fossil fuel production had the highest per capita emissions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Qatar (31.7 metric tons)** had the **highest CO₂ emissions per capita**, followed by **Bahrain (22.0), Brunei (21.7), Kuwait (21.2), and UAE (20.3)**.  \n",
